# Vaulty - secure and simple password manager mobile application

Vaulty is a password manager mobile application with simple and intuitive user interface that helps you store
and manage your passwords in a secure way. It uses AES-256 GCM encryption to encrypt your passwords and store
them in a local database.

Vaulty introduces a new way to manage your passwords.
Instead of having multiple versions of the app for different platforms,
you store your passwords only on your mobile device and copy them to other devices
using [Vaulty Remote Clipboard](https://github.com/astsu-dev/vaulty-remote-clipboard) desktop application.
In the result you have a single source of truth for your passwords and can access them from any device.
The user experience is similar to AirDrop feature on iOS.
